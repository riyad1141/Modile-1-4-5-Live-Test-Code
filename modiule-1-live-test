The Agile Model, or Agile methodology, is an iterative and incremental approach to software development.
It emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and customer feedback throughout the development process.
 Unlike traditional software development models, which follow a sequential and rigid process, Agile focuses on delivering working software in short iterations called "sprints."
 Popular Agile frameworks include Scrum, Kanban, and Extreme Programming (XP).
 Agile practices are widely used in the software industry due to their ability to deliver high-quality software rapidly, foster customer satisfaction, and promote efficient team collaboration.
